## Microsoft Learn Module Image Classification using Azure Sphere

[Microsoft Learn Module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/modules/image-classification-azure-sphere)

## This module cover the following 

Implement a neural network model for performing real-time image classification on a secured, internet-connected microcontroller-based device (Azure Sphere). Describe the components and steps for implementing a pre-trained image classification model on Azure Sphere.

## In this module, you will:

Implement image classification on a microcontroller device using a pre-trained neural network model.
Describe how the components and services of an Azure Sphere work to deploy a pre-trained image classification model.
